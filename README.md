In the temple of Vilyre, Sword fighting techniques come in 3 forms: Stabs, slashes, and dashes.

Stabs can be used to interrupt melee enemy atttacks, and have long and narrow range.

Slashes can counter enemy ranged attacks and have a wide range to hit.

Dashes are essential to any fight not only to dodge attacks, but to close the distance between your sword and your enemies.
